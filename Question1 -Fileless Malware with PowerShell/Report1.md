# 🛡️ Scenario 1: Fileless Malware with PowerShell

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate and detect a **fileless malware attack** where a malicious PowerShell payload is executed directly in memory (via base64-encoded command), often seen in spear-phishing campaigns.

---

## 🧪 Attack Simulation

### ✅ Method: Encoded PowerShell Execution
```powershell
# Create encoded command (safe example launching calc.exe)
$payload = 'Start-Process calc'
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($payload)
$encoded = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)
powershell -EncodedCommand $encoded
